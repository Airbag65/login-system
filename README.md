# login-system
This is a login system that I made with python. 
The information about the different accounts and their passwords are stored in the .json file. 
This little project was my first time working with JSON so it was firstly just ment to be a small thing to learn the basics, 
but it turned into something I genuinly think can be useful. 
It could be implemented as a login system for a larger problem. 
I will also add a way to sign up more accounts from the commandline in the future. 

# Update
The functionality to add new accounts has now also been implemented. 
The source code for that can be found in the add_account.py file.
For the entire program to run, you just simply run the login.py file and all the other files should be connected.
